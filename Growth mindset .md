#Growth Mindset

What is a  Growth Mindset:

It is a theory that affirms that it is possible to develop individual capabilities through learning, work and perseverance, and it opens the path for us to be able to define higher goals and greater achievements, and considers intelligence and talent only starting points.

Through the following points we maintain a growth mindset:

1- Challenges
Not to give up when facing a difficult problem, to return to thinking and how to solve it and to search for new ways of thinking.

2- Obstacles
When facing an obstacle we must maintain our focus.

3-Effort
An effort should always be made to improve ourselves and our performance.

4- Criticism
It means reviewing your days and evaluating your performance.

5- The success of others
Understand how work with colleagues and our cooperation relates.

#How to maintain growth theory for me:

1- Not giving up when difficult problems and trying to solve them in an innovative way.

2- Comparing myself now to myself in the past and what should I do to develop myself.

3- Considering the success of others motivated me to learn more and be successful as well.
