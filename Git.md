# Git

Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. 

## What is git:

### Snapshots

 is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. 

### Local Operations

Git mostly relies on local operations

### Tracking Changes

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.

### Loss of Data

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data.

### States

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

## Giting started

your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.
